            <p>
            I am a coding enthusiast with a B.S. in Mathematics and an M.S. in
            Financial Engineering from NYU. My portfolio reflects both my
            experience as a quantitative analyst as well as my interest in
            full-stack web development. I hope to combine my quantitative
            experience with my knowledge of web development to produce creative
            solutions for practical problems.
